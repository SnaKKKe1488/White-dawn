 SOV_true_russia:0 "The True Russia"
 SOV_true_russia_desc:0 "Admiral Kolchak's authoritarian regime has betrayed the revolutionary spirit that once ignited our nation. His oppressive rule stifles the voices of the people and crushes the dream of a workers' state. It is time to reignite the flames of revolution, dismantle Kolchak’s dictatorship, and restore the power of the Soviets. The time for reform is over; the time for revolution has come!"
 SOV_true_russia_tooltip:0 "§R This focus will unlock the true Russian path to socialism.§"
 SOV_february_values:0 "Values of February"
 SOV_february_values_desc:0 "The ideals of the February Revolution still echo through the halls of power. Democracy, personal freedoms, and a focus on civil rights were once the guiding lights of Russia. By embracing these values, we can return to a system where the people, not authoritarian rulers, shape the future of our nation. But are these values enough to navigate the turbulence ahead?"
 SOV_hold_elections:0 "Hold Elections"
 SOV_hold_elections_desc:0 "After years of authoritarian rule, the calls for democracy have grown too loud to ignore. Kolchak’s government must decide whether to open the door to free elections, risking the return of liberal and socialist forces to power, or continue to suppress the will of the people. A free and fair election could stabilize the country—or plunge it into chaos."
 SOV_coup_kolchak:0 "Coup Kolchak"
 SOV_coup_kolchak_desc:0 "Admiral Kolchak’s grip on power is weakening, and factions within the military and government are growing restless. Some believe that removing him from power through a swift and decisive coup is the only way to save Russia from further turmoil. The coup will be dangerous, but success could bring new leadership and direction to the fractured nation."
 SOV_stablish_SSR:0 "Establish The RSFSR"
 SOV_stablish_SSR_desc:0 "The time has come to restore the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as the vanguard of global socialism. By rebuilding the state along socialist lines, we can reunite the workers and peasants under a single banner, free from the chaos of civil war. The RSFSR will be a beacon of revolution, ready to spread its influence both within and beyond our borders."
 SOV_soviet_congress:0 "Convene The Soviet"
 SOV_soviet_congress_desc:0 "By convening the Soviet, we will gather the key representatives of the workers, peasants, and intellectuals to determine the party’s direction. With the old regime collapsing and new factions vying for control, the question of who will lead the revolution is more critical than ever. Will it be a revolutionary vanguard or a more moderate figure who takes the reins of power?"
 SOV_bukharins_legacy:0 "Under Bukharin’s Mantle"
 SOV_bukharins_legacy_desc:0 "Bukharin’s vision of socialism, based on cooperation between peasants and workers, offers a pragmatic path forward. His ideas of gradual collectivization, market socialism, and political compromise can stabilize Russia while keeping the dream of socialism alive. Under his mantle, we may build a state that avoids the extremism of both the past and present, offering hope for all."
 SOV_end_of_compromise:0 "Banner of Revolution"
 SOV_end_of_compromise_desc:0 "In these uncertain times, only the most disciplined, orthodox Marxist path can secure the future of the revolution. By forging a state of iron will, Under the Banner of Revolutionary Steel, we will crush all enemies of the proletariat and create a state that stands unshaken by the winds of history."
