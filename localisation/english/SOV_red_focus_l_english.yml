 SOV_true_russia:0 "The true Russia"
 SOV_true_russia_desc:0 "Admiral Kolchak’s reign has been a betrayal of the revolutionary spirit that once swept across Russia. His authoritarian regime has reestablished the very forms of oppression the people rose against in 1917. Under his iron fist, the dream of a workers’ state has been crushed, and the remnants of the White Army cling to power, suppressing the will of the people. But we have not forgotten the struggle of the proletariat. It is time to reignite the flames of revolution and bring an end to Kolchak’s reactionary rule. Through careful organization, the rallying of the Red Guard, and the reawakening of socialist ideals, we will dismantle the remnants of the White dictatorship. We will restore the power of the Soviets, abolish the oligarchs, and give birth to a new Red Russia. The time for reform is over; the time for revolution has come."
