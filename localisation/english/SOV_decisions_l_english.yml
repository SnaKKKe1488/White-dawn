 SOV_four_year_plan_category_desc:0 "Yezhov’s Four-Year Plan, known as "Strength through Unity," aims to rapidly transform Russia into an industrial powerhouse. The plan prioritizes heavy industry, infrastructure development, and a strengthened military to solidify national resilience and economic self-sufficiency. Yezhov’s approach focuses on centralized control over production and resource allocation, driving growth through state-led initiatives and strict labor organization. Although demanding in scope, "Strength through Unity" promises to lift Russia from instability, creating a stronger, unified nation that stands firm against both internal and external threats."
