 SOV_four_year_plan_category_desc:0 "Yezhov’s Four-Year Plan, known as "Strength through Unity," aims to rapidly transform Russia into an industrial powerhouse. The plan prioritizes heavy industry, infrastructure development, and a strengthened military to solidify national resilience and economic self-sufficiency. Yezhov’s approach focuses on centralized control over production and resource allocation, driving growth through state-led initiatives and strict labor organization. Although demanding in scope, "Strength through Unity" promises to lift Russia from instability, creating a stronger, unified nation that stands firm against both internal and external threats."

 SOV_4YP_1_desc:0 "The Soviet Union now faces an historic decision, one that will define the course of the proletariat for generations to come. Comrade Yezhov’s Four-Year Plan outlines an ambitious agenda that balances iron discipline and aggressive modernization with a relentless focus on industry and ideological purity. Factories must spring up from our barren lands, collective farms must nourish the workers, and arms production must become the backbone of our revolutionary defense. This plan will not be easy; indeed, it demands sacrifices that only the most loyal of the People’s Soviet could endure. But through collective struggle, and under Comrade Yezhov’s vigilant leadership, the Union can—and must—surpass all expectations to secure our vision of a classless society."
